"""The "Mu + Lambda" Simplification Modification

This module defines the basis of the "mu plus lambda"
evolutionary algorithm in bingo analyses with an added simplification component.
The next generation is evaluated and selected from both the parent and offspring
populations, along with a fixed number of simplified equations based on the same.

    A class for the "mu plus lambda" evolutionary algorithm in bingo.

    Parameters
    ----------
    evaluation : evaluation
        The evaluation algorithm that sets the fitness on the population.
    selection : selection
        selection instance to perform selection on a population
    crossover : Crossover
        The algorithm that performs crossover during variation.
    mutation : Mutation
        The algorithm that performs mutation during variation.
    crossover_probability : float
        Probability that crossover will occur on an individual.
    mutation_probability : float
        Probability that mutation will occur on an individual.
    number_offspring : int
        The number of offspring produced from variation.
    target_population_size : int (optional)
        The targeted population size. Default is to keep the population the
        same size as the starting population

    variation : VarOr
                VarOr variation to perform variation on a population
